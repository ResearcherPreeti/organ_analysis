Clinical Data File (clinical_data.json)
The clinical data file contains detailed tabular information about patient demographics, vital statistics, and health-related parameters. Each record includes the patient's age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and lifestyle habits such as exercise frequency and smoking status. Additionally, it captures critical medical conditions like diabetes and assigns a disease label indicating the presence of cardiovascular, renal, or pulmonary diseases. This data is structured to support clinical analysis, ensuring relevance to a wide range of healthcare scenarios. The attributes are thoughtfully chosen to align with factors commonly monitored in routine medical assessments and health screenings, providing a comprehensive foundation for medical research and decision-making processes.

Text Data File (text_data.json)
The text data file contains narrative-style clinical notes that provide contextual insights into patient histories and lifestyle factors. Each note integrates information about the patient's diabetes status, smoking habits, and exercise patterns, creating a holistic view of their health profile. These textual records mimic the type of information typically recorded during physician consultations or extracted from electronic health records (EHRs). The narrative format enhances interpretability by healthcare professionals and allows for the application of advanced natural language processing (NLP) models for tasks such as disease classification, trend analysis, and personalized healthcare recommendations.

Image Data File (image_data.pkl)
The image data file includes high-dimensional feature vectors representing medical imaging outputs. Each vector is a condensed representation of imaging modalities like X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans, processed through sophisticated feature extraction techniques. This data simulates the outputs that clinicians and researchers might use to identify patterns, diagnose conditions, or monitor disease progression. The feature-rich representations ensure compatibility with modern machine learning and deep learning models, supporting advanced analytics in healthcare. This dataset complements the clinical and text data by adding a visual diagnostic layer, enabling multimodal research and development in medical AI applications.
